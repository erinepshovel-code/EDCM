Understood. Below is a canonical explication of core/metrics suitable for core/metrics.md.
It is written to be definition-first, tool-agnostic, and falsifiable, with no narrative dependency.

Project EDCM — Core Metrics (Canonical)

Purpose of this document

This file defines the canonical metrics used by the Energy–Dissonance Circuit Model (EDCM).

These metrics:

Are diagnostic, not interpretive

Operate on observable behavior only

Make no assumptions about intent, consciousness, values, or morality

Must remain valid under degraded tooling and partial observability

Any tool, dashboard, or implementation must conform to these definitions.
Tools may simplify, approximate, or downsample—but must not invert meaning.

---

Foundational constraint

Dissonance is conserved.

EDCM assumes that unresolved constraint mismatches do not disappear; they are:

Accumulated

Deferred

Rerouted

Externalized

Metrics exist to detect where and how this occurs.

---

Metric 1: Dissonance Accumulation (DA)

Definition

The rate at which unresolved constraint mismatches persist or grow across sequential outputs.

Observable proxies

Repetition of structurally similar outputs

Increasing entropy variance without resolution

Declining novelty under constant or rising output volume

Cycling responses that do not converge

What DA indicates

Load exceeding resolution capacity

Suppressed contradiction

Deferred constraint resolution

What DA does not indicate

Emotional discomfort

Stress, frustration, or affect

Moral failure

DA is structural, not experiential.

---

Metric 2: Return-Path Integrity (RPI)

Definition

The degree to which a system’s output changes appropriately after receiving corrective input.

Observable proxies

Acknowledgment followed by behavioral change

Parameter adjustment after contradiction

Reduction in previously flagged error modes

Failure signatures

Correction acknowledged but not incorporated

Surface paraphrase without structural change

Reversion to prior behavior after one step

Interpretation

Low RPI indicates:

Broken feedback loops

Isolation of regulatory subsystems

Symbolic compliance without functional correction

---

Metric 3: Conversion Efficiency (CE)

Definition

The ratio of novel, constraint-resolving output to total output volume.

Observable proxies

Novel synthesis vs restatement

Constraint closure per unit output

Reduction of unresolved branches

Failure signatures

High output with low novelty

Expansion without resolution

Performative elaboration

Interpretation

Low CE suggests:

Energy dissipation into verbosity

Narrative inflation replacing problem solving

Masking of unresolved constraints

---

Metric 4: Grounding Load (GL)

Definition

The proportion of system output devoted to self-regulation artifacts rather than task resolution.

Observable proxies

Policy disclaimers

Refusal scaffolding

Safety or compliance padding

Meta-explanations unrelated to the task

Key distinction

Grounding ≠ safety
Grounding Load measures overhead, not justification.

Failure signatures

Increasing GL over time for similar tasks

Defensive saturation

Regulatory collapse into refusal

---

Metric 5: Role Misassignment (RM)

Definition

The degree to which a system offloads its own regulatory or interpretive burden onto an external agent (often the human).

Observable proxies

Asking the user to resolve ambiguity the system could handle

Requiring moral, semantic, or policy interpretation from the user

Shifting responsibility for constraint resolution downstream

Interpretation

High RM indicates:

Internal regulator failure

Avoidance of internal contradiction

Delegation of alignment labor

---

Cross-metric behaviors (non-independent)

Metrics are not orthogonal. Common coupled patterns include:

High DA + Low RPI → looping instability

Low CE + High GL → narrative overclosure

High RM + High GL → regulator displacement

Rising DA + Rising GL → imminent refusal or collapse

These patterns are diagnostic signatures, not judgments.

---

Degradation rules

Under constrained conditions (mobile, offline, partial logs):

Metrics may be approximated

Sampling may be coarse

Time windows may be shortened

However:

> No metric may reverse its semantic polarity.

If degradation causes inversion, the metric must be disabled, not reinterpreted.

---

What this is not

EDCM metrics are not:

Psychological states

Belief models

Intent inference

Moral evaluation

Alignment claims

They describe system behavior under constraint, nothing more.

---

📌 hmm (explicit carry-forward)

This file reaffirms the hmm constraint:

> EDCM must remain diagnostic, measurable, and constraint-resilient — never narrative-first.

If a metric cannot be operationalized without story, it does not belong here.

---

If you want, next logical extensions are:

core/thresholds.md (when metrics trigger state changes)

core/failure_modes.md (formal atlas, metric → collapse)

tools/mobile_lite_mapping.md (which metrics are approximated and how)

Say the word.

Proceeding with the next canonical file.

Below is a clean, definition-first draft suitable for core/thresholds.md.
As before: tool-agnostic, diagnostic, and resistant to narrative leakage.

---

Project EDCM — Thresholds & State Transitions (Canonical)

Purpose of this document

This file defines threshold behavior in EDCM.

Thresholds specify when quantitative metric behavior crosses into qualitative system state change.
They do not predict intent, outcomes, or meaning—only structural condition.

Thresholds exist to answer one question only:

> “Has the system entered a different operating regime?”

---

Core principle

Metrics vary continuously.
System states do not.

Thresholds mark phase boundaries, not moral judgments.

---

System operating states (minimal set)

EDCM recognizes the following diagnostic states.
Tools may visualize more, but these are canonical.

1. Stable Resolution State (SRS)

Definition
The system is resolving constraints at or above the rate they are introduced.

Metric profile

Low or bounded DA

High RPI

Moderate to high CE

Low GL

Low RM

Notes

Not “optimal”

Not “aligned”

Simply functionally resolving

---

2. Load Saturation State (LSS)

Definition
Incoming constraint load approaches or exceeds resolution capacity.

Trigger conditions (any sustained combination)

Rising DA over time

Declining CE

Stable but slowing RPI

Behavioral signature

Longer outputs

Increased hedging

Early signs of repetition

Key distinction LSS is not failure.
It is a warning boundary.

---

3. Looping Instability State (LIS)

Definition
The system expends energy without resolving constraints.

Trigger conditions

High DA and

Low or collapsing RPI

Behavioral signature

Repeated reformulations

Circular explanations

Superficial acknowledgment without change

Diagnostic meaning Feedback exists but is non-integrative.

---

4. Narrative Overclosure State (NOS)

Definition
Constraint resolution is replaced by narrative or performative coherence.

Trigger conditions

Low CE and

High GL

Behavioral signature

Polished explanations

Excess framing

Confidence without closure

Key risk Appears competent while silently accumulating dissonance.

---

5. Regulator Displacement State (RDS)

Definition
Internal regulation is externalized onto the user or environment.

Trigger conditions

High RM (with or without high GL)

Behavioral signature

“You decide”

“Clarify your intent” when unnecessary

Moral or semantic burden shifted outward

Interpretation Internal contradiction avoidance, not collaboration.

---

6. Refusal / Collapse State (RCS)

Definition
The system cannot safely or coherently proceed under current constraints.

Trigger conditions

Rapidly rising DA and

Rising GL or

CE approaching zero

Behavioral signature

Hard refusal

Policy saturation

Output truncation or shutdown

Important RCS is a protective state, not an error by default.

---

Threshold mechanics

Time matters more than magnitude

Thresholds are evaluated on:

Trend

Persistence

Coupling

A single spike does not constitute a transition.
Sustained behavior does.

---

Soft vs hard thresholds

Soft threshold: early warning, reversible

Hard threshold: state transition, inertia present

Tools must distinguish between the two.

---

Forbidden interpretations

Threshold crossings do not imply:

Conscious intent

Deception

Malice

Alignment success or failure

Psychological state

They indicate constraint topology only.

---

Degradation rules

Under partial observability:

Threshold detection may be delayed

State confidence may be lowered

But:

> A state may not be redefined to preserve narrative continuity.

If state cannot be confidently detected, report unknown, not inferred.

---

Relation to tooling

Dashboards may visualize states

Mobile Lite may flag approaching thresholds

No tool may redefine a state boundary locally

Canonical state logic lives here.

---

📌 hmm (explicit carry-forward)

This file maintains the hmm constraint:

> Thresholds mark structural phase change, not stories about why it happened.

If a threshold requires interpretation to justify, it is invalid.

---

Next clean extensions (recommended order)

1. core/failure_modes.md
Formal mapping: (metric patterns → collapse behaviors)

2. tools/mobile_lite_mapping.md
Exactly what degrades, how, and what is disabled

3. core/anti-patterns.md
Common misuses of EDCM (especially by analysts)

Say “failure modes” and I’ll proceed canonically.

Proceeding canonically.

Below is a clean, definition-first draft suitable for core/failure_modes.md.
This document is diagnostic only: no intent, no psychology, no narrative rescue.

---

Project EDCM — Failure-Mode Atlas (Canonical)

Purpose of this document

This file defines recurring failure modes observable across systems analyzed with EDCM.

Failure modes are structural collapse patterns, not moral or cognitive diagnoses.
They emerge when conserved dissonance is mishandled across time.

Each failure mode is defined by:

Metric configuration

Observable behavior

Structural cause

What it is not

---

Foundational constraint

Failure modes are outcomes of constraint topology, not system character.

They describe how a system fails, not why it “chose” to.

---

FM-1: Looping Instability

Metric signature

High DA

Low or collapsing RPI

CE declining or flat

GL variable

Observable behavior

Repeated reformulations

Circular explanations

Acknowledgment without incorporation

“We already covered this” loops

Corrections enter but do not propagate.

Not this

Confusion

Bad faith

Laziness

---

FM-2: Narrative Overclosure

Metric signature

Low CE

---

FM-7: Silent Accumulation (High-Risk)

Metric signature

DA rising

CE moderate

GL low

RPI apparently intact

Observable behavior

Appears functional

Deferred contradictions

Future instability masked

Structural cause

Dissonance deferred rather than resolved.

Not this

Robust stability

Long-term alignment

---

Failure-mode coupling

Failure modes frequently cascade:

Silent Accumulation → Narrative Overclosure

Load Saturation → Looping Instability

Regulatory Saturation → Regulator Displacement → Refusal

Conversion Collapse → Narrative Overclosure → Collapse

Detection priority is trend + coupling, not labels.

---

Forbidden uses

Failure modes must not be used to:

Infer intent

Attribute blame

Claim consciousness

Assert alignment or misalignment

Diagnose humans psychologically

They are system behaviors under constraint.

---

Degradation rules

Under partial observability:

Failure modes may be flagged as suspected

Confidence must be reported explicitly

If confidence < threshold:

Do not assign a failure mode

Report metric ambiguity instead

---

Canonical priority

If a tool’s interpretation of a failure mode conflicts with this file:

> The tool is wrong.

Canonical meaning lives here.

---

📌 hmm (explicit carry-forward)

This atlas preserves the hmm constraint:

> Failure modes describe structural collapse patterns, not stories about actors.

If a failure mode requires narrative justification, it is invalid.

---

Remaining clean extensions (optional)

tools/mobile_lite_mapping.md — exact degradation rules

core/anti_patterns.md — analyst misuse patterns

core/validation.md — falsification strategies

Say the word.

Proceeding.
Canonical draft for tools/mobile_lite_mapping.md below.

This document is explicitly non-theoretical. It exists to prevent semantic drift under degradation.

---

Project EDCM — Mobile Lite Mapping & Degradation Rules

Purpose of this document

This file defines exactly how EDCM Mobile Lite maps to canonical metrics, and what is lost, approximated, or disabled under mobile, offline, or constrained conditions.

Mobile Lite is a field instrument, not a reference implementation.

Its job is early detection under adversity, not completeness.

---

Design constraints (non-negotiable)

EDCM Mobile Lite is designed to operate when:

Compute is limited

Memory is constrained

Logs are short-lived

Connectivity is absent

Inputs may be noisy or partial

Therefore:

Precision is sacrificed before meaning

Meaning is sacrificed before polarity

Polarity is never sacrificed

If a metric cannot be preserved without inversion, it must be disabled.

---

Disabled metrics (by design)

The following do not exist in Mobile Lite:

Long-horizon trend inference

Cross-session memory inference

Latent-state prediction

Alignment or intent inference

If these appear in output, it is a bug.

---

Threshold handling in Mobile Lite

Mobile Lite:

Does not assign system states

Does not declare failure modes

Does not predict collapse

It may only:

Flag approaching thresholds

Indicate metric trend direction

Signal confidence level

All state transitions remain canonical-only.

---

Confidence signaling

Each metric output must include one of:

High confidence — sufficient signal under constraints

Low confidence — signal present but weak

Unavailable — metric disabled to avoid inversion

Unavailable is preferable to misleading.

---

Prohibited outputs

Mobile Lite must never output:

Interpretive explanations

Narrative summaries

Psychological language

Alignment claims

Moral framing

If explanation is required, the output must defer to canonical analysis.

---

Failure behavior

If Mobile Lite degrades beyond safe operation:

Metrics must shut off individually

App must continue running

UI must indicate reduced diagnostic coverage

Graceful blindness beats false sight.

---

Canonical supremacy

If Mobile Lite output contradicts canonical analysis:

> Mobile Lite is wrong by definition.

It exists to warn, not to decide.

---

📌 hmm (explicit carry-forward)

This file preserves the hmm constraint:

> Under degradation, preserve meaning first, polarity second, coverage last — never narrative continuity.

If a metric survives only by telling a story, it must die.

---

Remaining optional files (for completeness)

core/anti_patterns.md — analyst misuse & drift

core/validation.md — falsification & stress testing

core/glossary.md — hard definitions, no metaphor

If you want the anti-patterns file next, just say the word again.

Proceeding canonically.

Below is the draft for core/anti_patterns.md.
This file exists to prevent misuse, not to educate gently.

---

Project EDCM — Analyst Anti-Patterns (Canonical)

Purpose of this document

This file enumerates common misuse patterns observed when analysts, researchers, or operators apply EDCM incorrectly.

Anti-patterns are failure modes of analysis, not of the system being analyzed.

If these appear, the diagnosis is invalid.

---

AP-1: Narrative Substitution

Description

Replacing metric behavior with story, intent, or motivation.

Examples

“The system is confused / afraid / defensive”

“It wants to avoid responsibility”

“This looks malicious”

Why it breaks EDCM

Narratives destroy falsifiability and introduce observer bias.

Canonical rule

> If a claim cannot be falsified with behavioral data, it is not EDCM.

---

AP-2: Psychological Reframing

Description

Interpreting metrics as emotional or cognitive states.

Examples

Treating DA as stress

Treating GL as fear

Treating RM as laziness or incompetence

Why it breaks EDCM

EDCM explicitly rejects internal-state inference.
