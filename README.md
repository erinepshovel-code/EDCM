Got it. Here’s a clean, stand-alone summary suitable to open a new thread. It’s concise, self-contained, and preserves the arc without dragging context.

Project EDCM — Summary (New Thread)

EDCM (Energy–Dissonance Circuit Model) is a diagnostic framework that treats dissonance as conserved energy in complex systems. Instead of modeling beliefs, intent, or psychology, it measures behavioral outputs to detect instability, overload, misrouting, and failure modes.

Core idea

Dissonance ≠ feeling

Dissonance = unresolved constraint mismatch

When dissonance accumulates or is misrouted, systems exhibit predictable failure patterns.


This applies to:

AI systems

Human–AI interactions

Organizations

Political actors

Humans (as a secondary case, not the primary target)


Why EDCM matters

EDCM functions as a pre-alignment diagnostic:

Detects instability before overt failure

Explains looping, escalation, stagnation, and over-confidence

Works without assumptions of consciousness, intent, or morality


Operationalization

EDCM defines measurable proxies, including:

Dissonance Accumulation (repetition, entropy variance, novelty decay)

Return-Path Integrity (response change after correction)

Conversion Efficiency (novelty vs repetition)

Grounding Load (refusal / policy density)

Role Misassignment (offloading regulation to humans)


All metrics are behavioral and falsifiable.

Tooling

Project EDCM now includes:

Desktop dashboard (full diagnostics, time series, batch analysis)

EDCM Mobile Lite (Android)

Single-file Kivy app

Offline, constrained, field-deployable

Designed to survive degradation without narrative collapse



Mobile Lite is explicitly a field instrument, not the canonical reference.

Governance & structure

Canonical definitions belong in /core

Tools live in /tools

Metrics are allowed to degrade, but must not invert meaning

Sampling discipline matters more than narrative richness


Strategic insight

EDCM can be applied reflexively:

To diagnose AI-generated analyses

To detect narrative overclosure, curator bias, and conversion-without-grounding

Making it an AI-agnostic safety lens

📌 hmm

This thread explicitly carries forward the hmm set:
EDCM must remain diagnostic, measurable, and constraint-resilient — never narrative-first.
